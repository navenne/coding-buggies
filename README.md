You're a dev trying to get that program to work...but those bugs just won't stop bugging you! For how much time can you avoid the Â¿bUgGiES? without getting too stressed out to continue?

[Play the game on itch.io](https://navenne.itch.io/coding-buggies)

##### INSTRUCTIONS
1. Move with arrow keys.
2. Don't let the bugs hit you!
3. If you get hit by a bug you'll get stressed.
4. If you get hit 3 times...game over :(
